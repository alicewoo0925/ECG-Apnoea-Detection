# ECG-Apnoea-Detection

## Abstract
Our team has investigated methods to automate sleep apnoea detection using ECG data taken from sleeping subjects. The data is used to create a predictive algorithm that is able to label samples as positive for a sleep apnoea episode or negative for normal sleep. This is important because current sleep apnoea detection methods are typically either inaccurate or extremely inconvenient, meaning it is very underdiagnosed. A programmatic approach was undertaken using both MATLAB and Python machine learning methods. Unfortunately, we are yet to yield a model that can perform well enough for clinical diagnosis, with our best classifier yielding an ROC value of 0.6185. However, with limited time and knowledge we believe this to be a decent result and it displays the potential for further research in this field. With improvements to QRS detection algorithms and tuning more advanced machine learning models it is definitely possible that one day owners of wearable heart rate monitors will have access to reliable sleep apnoea detection software.
